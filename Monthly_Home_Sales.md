## Preliminary analysis

The assumption that our time series is a realization of a stationary process is clearly fundamental in time series analysis, so we
must first determine whether the series can be considered a realization of a stationary process.In this stage a very useful tool is
the graph of the series, many of the patterns in the data can be seen visually.
